# RAscii
RAscii Project (GFA Source [Atari St OBJ])
#
RAscii is code written in GFA Basic (3.6)
-
Program will create an raw ascii file (256 Bytes)
All completely random (No Repeats)
Process is for creating seed files for random data used
in Key files for PGP and or other key formats which need
a pure random seed pattern for secure key files.

As of this date we have not been able to port said code
to other languages (WIP)
